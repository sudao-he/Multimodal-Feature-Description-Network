# Multimodal Feature Description Network
 This repository is Multimodal Feature Description Network for aligning RGB-IR image pairs in building facade inspection.

This is the first part of the code for our paper: 
[Weakly-aligned Cross-modal Learning Framework for Subsurface Defect Segmentation on Building Facades Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4845688) 
submitted to ***Automation in Construction***.

The code will be opened to the public after the publication of our paper.
